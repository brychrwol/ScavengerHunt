$dbpassword = "your_mysql_password";
$dbname = "your_mysql_database_name";

$ftpAddress = "your_ftp_address_(ie_localhost)";
$ftpUsername = "your_ftp_username";
$ftpPassword = "your_ftp_username";

$dbh = mysql_connect ("localhost", $dbusername, $dbpassword) or die ("Could not connect to server:".mysql_error());
mysql_select_db($dbname, $dbh) or die("Could not open databsase:".mysql_error());
